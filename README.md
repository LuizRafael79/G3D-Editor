# G3D-Editor - Geodata Editor Revisited

This project was created by Forsaiken of L2JServer, and is a fork of the original project available on Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/g3d-editor/).

In addition to being a Geodata viewer and editor, in the future it will also have the ability to extract Geodata directly from the client.

The version will follow from the last released version, 1.5, so this version will be 1.6.

## Changes:

Primarily updating all code from Java 8 to Java 25. Initially, the code was only ported to be compiled with Java 25. It was not fully ported to Java 25; this is a work in progress.

## Requirements:

- Java 17+ (25 recommended) - Updated from Java 8
- JOGL (Java OpenGL bindings) - Updated from 2011 version
- GlueGen (JOGL runtime dependency) - Updated from 2011 version

## License

The project follows the original GPLv3 license.
